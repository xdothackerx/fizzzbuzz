Project Title: Fizzbuzz Advanced</h4>

Approach: Wrote down what inputs the client wanted, planned out what was needed to make a user-friendly feature as described.
Researched meta programming in Ruby with the keywords "methods that create methods" and similar. Attempted to make similarly structured method, tried a few different things, and it eventually worked.
Wrote tests to make sure custom method had the desired functionality.
